I am a Ph.D. student in Robotics at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Dr. [Yue Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dDPQH3oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my master's degree in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD) at the Robotic Institute, Carnegie Mellon University [(CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I worked in [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/) with Prof. [Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/). I received my B.Eng. degree in Mechanical Engineering (Hsue-shen Tsien Honor Class) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University [(SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My research interest lies in general medical robots and robot manipulation. Particularly, I focus on surgical robot system design, modeling and planning for continuum robots, and robotic grippers for in-hand manipulation. I also study control and planning for autonomous driving and SLAM.

Additionally, I was fortunate to work with Profs. [Kenneth Salisbury](https://profiles.stanford.edu/john-salisbury?releaseVersion=10.8.0), [Gregory Chirikjian](https://chirikjianlab.github.io/) and [Zhinan Zhang](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/zhangzhinan.html) before.
